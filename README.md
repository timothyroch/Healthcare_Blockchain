
# **Healthcare Blockchain Project**

## **Overview**

The **Healthcare Blockchain Project** is a decentralized application designed to securely store, manage, and share patient medical records using blockchain technology. It gives patients full control over their data, enabling them to grant or revoke access to healthcare providers. The system ensures data integrity, privacy, and auditability, while leveraging off-chain storage for efficient data management.

## **Features**

- **Patient-Controlled Access**: Patients can grant and revoke access to their medical records.
- **Immutable Records**: Records are securely stored on the blockchain, ensuring data integrity.
- **Role-Based Dashboards**: Custom dashboards for patients and doctors.
- **Off-Chain Storage**: Efficient storage of large medical records using IPFS or cloud services.
- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication with role-based access control.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed for large-scale deployments.
