Here’s a comprehensive **`README.md`** for your **`encryption`** folder:

# **Encryption Module**

## **Overview**

The **Encryption Module** is responsible for securing sensitive data, such as medical records, by providing encryption, decryption, and hashing functionalities. It ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and secure transmission/storage of sensitive information.

## **Folder Structure**

```plaintext
encryption/
├── keys/                     # Stores public and private keys for encryption
│   ├── private.pem           # Private key (used for decryption)
│   └── public.pem            # Public key (used for encryption)
├── encryption_utils.js       # Utility functions for encryption, decryption, and hashing
└── README.md                 # Documentation for the encryption module
```

## **Key Features**

- **RSA Key Pair Generation**:
  - Generates a public and private key pair for asymmetric encryption.
  - Public key is used for encrypting data, while the private key is used for decrypting.

- **Data Encryption and Decryption**:
  - Encrypts data using the public key.
  - Decrypts encrypted data using the private key.

- **Data Integrity Verification**:
  - Hashes data using the SHA-256 algorithm.
  - Verifies the integrity of data by comparing hashes.

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Generate RSA Keys**

To generate a new pair of RSA keys, run the following command in your code:
```javascript
const { generateKeys } = require('./encryption_utils');
generateKeys();
```

This will create:
- **`private.pem`**: Used for decrypting data.
- **`public.pem`**: Used for encrypting data.

### **2. Encrypt and Decrypt Data**

Encrypt sensitive data with the public key and decrypt it with the private key:
```javascript
const { encryptData, decryptData } = require('./encryption_utils');

const data = "Sensitive medical record";

// Encrypt the data
const encrypted = encryptData(data);
console.log("Encrypted:", encrypted);

// Decrypt the data
const decrypted = decryptData(encrypted);
console.log("Decrypted:", decrypted);
```

### **3. Hash Data and Verify Integrity**

Hash data to ensure its integrity and verify the hash:
```javascript
const { hashData, verifyHash } = require('./encryption_utils');

const data = "File content or data to hash";

// Generate the hash
const hash = hashData(data);
console.log("Hash:", hash);

// Verify the hash
const isValid = verifyHash(data, hash);
console.log("Hash is valid:", isValid);
```

## **Configuration**

Ensure the `keys/` folder is properly secured and contains the following files:
- `private.pem`: Private key for decryption.
- `public.pem`: Public key for encryption.

If these files are not present, run the **`generateKeys`** function to create them.

---

## **Best Practices**

1. **Secure Private Keys**:
   - Never expose the private key in your codebase.
   - Store private keys securely (e.g., in a hardware security module or cloud key management service).

2. **Key Rotation**:
   - Rotate the encryption keys periodically to maintain security.

3. **Data Encryption**:
   - Always encrypt sensitive data before storing or transmitting it.

4. **Use Strong Hashing**:
   - The SHA-256 hashing algorithm is used to ensure data integrity. Consider using HMAC for additional security.

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **Keys Not Found**:
   - If the `keys/` folder is empty or the keys are missing, run the `generateKeys` function to create new keys.

2. **Decryption Fails**:
   - Ensure you are using the correct private key that corresponds to the public key used for encryption.

3. **Hash Mismatch**:
   - Verify that the data has not been altered. A hash mismatch indicates potential data corruption or tampering.
