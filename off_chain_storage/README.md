# **Off-Chain Storage Module**

## **Overview**

The **Off-Chain Storage Module** handles the storage and retrieval of large files (e.g., medical records, images, PDFs) outside the blockchain. This approach ensures cost-effective and scalable data storage while maintaining the integrity and accessibility of data by storing file hashes on the blockchain.

## **Key Features**

1. **Cloud Storage Integration**:
   - Enables file uploads to cloud storage providers like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.
   - Supports secure and scalable storage solutions.

2. **IPFS Integration**:
   - Allows decentralized storage of files using the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS).
   - Files are stored off-chain, with only their hashes stored on the blockchain to ensure immutability and integrity.

3. **Hybrid Storage Architecture**:
   - Combines the reliability of cloud storage with the decentralization of IPFS for optimal performance and security.

## **Usage**

### **1. Cloud Storage**

#### **Setup**
1. Configure the cloud storage credentials in your environment variables:
   ```plaintext
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
   AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
   ```

2. Use the cloud storage module to upload and retrieve files:
   ```javascript
   const { uploadToCloud, downloadFromCloud } = require('./cloud_storage/cloud_utils');

   // Upload a file to cloud storage
   uploadToCloud('path/to/local/file.txt', 'file.txt')
     .then((url) => console.log('File uploaded to:', url))
     .catch((err) => console.error('Upload failed:', err));

   // Download a file from cloud storage
   downloadFromCloud('file.txt', 'path/to/save/file.txt')
     .then(() => console.log('File downloaded successfully'))
     .catch((err) => console.error('Download failed:', err));
   ```

### **2. IPFS**

#### **Setup**
1. Install IPFS client:
   ```bash
   npm install ipfs-http-client
   ```

2. Use the IPFS module to upload and retrieve files:
   ```javascript
   const { uploadToIPFS, getFromIPFS } = require('./ipfs/ipfs_utils');

   // Upload a file to IPFS
   uploadToIPFS('path/to/local/file.txt')
     .then((hash) => console.log('File uploaded to IPFS with hash:', hash))
     .catch((err) => console.error('Upload failed:', err));

   // Retrieve a file from IPFS
   getFromIPFS('QmYourFileHash')
     .then((content) => console.log('File retrieved:', content))
     .catch((err) => console.error('Retrieval failed:', err));
   ```

## **Best Practices**

1. **Store Hashes on the Blockchain**:
   - Only store file hashes (not the actual files) on the blockchain to ensure data integrity without incurring high costs.

2. **Secure Cloud Storage**:
   - Use encrypted connections and secure access keys for cloud storage.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive files.

3. **Backups**:
   - Ensure regular backups of important files stored in the cloud or IPFS.

4. **Data Redundancy**:
   - Use both IPFS and cloud storage for redundancy to ensure availability even if one storage system fails.

## **Troubleshooting**

1. **File Upload Fails**:
   - Check your internet connection.
   - Ensure that the cloud storage credentials or IPFS node configuration is correct.

2. **Cannot Retrieve File from IPFS**:
   - Verify that the IPFS hash is correct and accessible.
   - Ensure that the IPFS node is running and reachable.

3. **Cloud Storage Access Issues**:
   - Ensure that the access keys and bucket name are properly configured.
   - Check your cloud storage account for any restrictions or limitations.

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Encryption**:
   - Add support for encrypting files before uploading to enhance security.

2. **Automatic Backups**:
   - Automate the backup process for files stored in the cloud or IPFS.

3. **Multi-Cloud Support**:
   - Extend support to multiple cloud providers for better redundancy and flexibility.

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Provide a user-friendly interface for managing off-chain storage directly from the frontend.
